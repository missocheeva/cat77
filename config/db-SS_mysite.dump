It was wonderful to see them settled in their new homes in pairs and a few went to homes with an existing cat for company. I feel it must be really lonely for one kitten on its own in a flat. Instead of playing with a companion it will destroy the furnishings!</p>\n<p>We have had many domestic cats brought to us for re-homing sadly due to a wide range of circumstances, luckily we were able to re-home many of them but as soon as they moved on to their new families more would arrive. Sadly many people seem to see cats as short term pets wanting to pass them on after a few years. With cats now living quite happily into their late teens or early twenties because of improved vet care it is a worrying situation.</p>\n<p>On the weekend of the Antiques Fair at the end of November, Jersey was hit by a snowstorm and the sale closed early as everyone was worried about driving in the snow. Jersey is not used to this! On the Sunday the roads were icy and again the fair closed early. Amazingly we still raised over £840! Needless to say the cats were not amused by the snow and had to be kept cosy with microwaveable heat pads!</p>\n<p>Due to the very cold conditions trapping has been very slow so it has been a good time to home some of the cats from the end of summer. No sooner did most of the younger ferals find permanent homes then three pairs of older cats arrived. They were all cats I had homed before and they were returning due to various reasons. I would like to ask people to consider taking on the older cats as they are so loving and gentle, they can be a good option for people who may not want to be committed to 20 years of cat care. It is sad when people insist on taking kittens, because an older cat may die and then pass on those same cats in a couple of years!</p>\n<p>To update last newsletters story on FIV cats:</p>\n<p>Piper and River have both found lovely homes and have settled very well into their indoor life.</p>\n<p>Spider and Squeak are lovely 12 year old brothers who lost their home on the death of their owner.

They have either been abandoned, unclaimed strays or cats and kittens disclaimed to us. A lot of the disclaimers have been in pairs and it has not been easy trying to find them good homes.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the main newsletter we still have young feral cats looking for homes that we trapped last year. Some of these were only 3 months old when we first had them and 12 months on they are still with us. Nikki has kindly taken on Cash and Fraser for the time being, not only to give Jean a bit more space but to give them a bit of one to one as these 2 lovely cats, brother and sister, were trapped a year ago on a private property with their mum. Mum was returned where she is fed by the owner but her offspring have yet to find that forever home. Though a little nervous they have become very affectionate and sleep on Nikki’s bed at night with her own cats. Owlett and Howlett, two black and white brother and sister caught last December are also still looking for a home.</p>\n<p>One ex feral kitten we homed last summer to be a friend to a kitten that was obtained privately came back to us recently plus the kitten she had been living with. This must be what they call two for the price of one! The reason was an apparent allergy with a member of the family. The ex feral kitten is now friendlier than her domestic companion and both found a lovely new home together.</p>\n<p>Fozzy Bear was another unwanted cat. She had lived at a large country property all her life but at the age of 6 years her original owners moved and asked for the new owners to look after her. Sadly we were asked to take her in as apparently she scared their horse with her miaowing and yet we saw neighbouring cats in the vicinity so hope they are silent around the horse! Thankfully due to the television/radio coverage we received in August, she found a lovely home with a large garden as an only cat and is very much loved by her new owners.</p>\n<p>We had to set up a new feeding site late July at Val de la Mare reservoir after a young cat was seen on one of the paths. It proved quite difficult to trap in this area as it was so close to the path that dogs kept discovering the feeding box hidden in ferns and sloe bushes and tipping it over to try and reach the biscuits. Once the ferns died off at the end of summer we had no sustainable cover which meant moving the feeding box to where there was a bit more undergrowth. Initially it was quite a walk to get to the spot but luckily we found a short-cut which meant only an 8 minute walk instead of 20 although it did incur climbing many steps and a very steep slope. A walk around the reservoir is very pleasurable under normal circumstances but at night when carrying traps, sacking to cover them with, food etc it’s a different story. (See article in main newsletter).</p>\n<p>We then heard the news that the reservoir was to be closed for 12 weeks due to the general public not observing the safety notices posted along the reservoir which was a complete blow to us. After a few phone calls and meetings we obtained permission from Jersey Water and the Security people involved to keep feeding and trapping at the reservoir. This was music to our ears. We would like to thank Mr Snowden and Mr Morris from Jersey Water and G4 for their co-operation in letting us continue our work during this period.</p>\n<p>While trapping at the reservoir we helped to find a missing cat called Tails who had been missing for 7 months and lived about a mile away. Tails was an enormous 9 year old dark ginger cat and went missing while his owners were on holiday. It was wonderful to see Tails back home with his caring owners as he had been very much missed by his family.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it seems to be another year for picking up dumped cats and kittens – it appears that no amount of advertising in English and other languages spoken in the Island, stating that this is an unacceptable way of “disposing” of unwanted kittens, seems to be making any difference at all which is very disheartening. Even offering to help with spaying and neutering is being ignored. Unfortunately the following stories prove this.</p>\n<p>In the main newsletter we mention Daisy, a very pretty pale grey tabby kitten that was knocked down in the middle of a road leading off the Five Mile Road. She was only about 9 weeks old but miraculously survived. Initially it was thought she was a feral as she was quite “lively” but once in a loving home environment with plenty of attention she became completely at ease and within a few days was playing like any normal kitten of her age. She was a domestic kitten that had been dumped as she could not have got to where she was found by herself at that age and no others were found in the vicinity. Daisy is certainly one very lucky kitten to have been found by caring people who were actually prepared to give her a loving home. You can see the most delightful pictures of her on our Facebook page.</p>\n<p>We are sure that Lottie was abandoned as she was never claimed despite advertising her as found. She was black and white, under a year old, considerably thin, had no microchip and had not been spayed. Concerned CAT’77 supporters had been watching her around an allotment for some time and were sure she had no home to go to so eventually brought her to us. She has since found a lovely home with the family that found her.</p>\n<p>We continued feeding at Noirmont Point throughout the year as cat paw prints were still appearing in the sand. Late August Sam went to top up the biscuits one morning and luckily spotted a small black kitten near one of the bunkers as it ran into the gorse. Within the next 48 hours we trapped this beautiful little black boy who was between 8 and 9 weeks old and once again definitely not a feral. He was scared but once he realised he was safe he happily let us stroke him once back at Jean’s. We needed to be sure there were no other siblings so monitored the site for a few weeks looking out for tiny paw prints and leaving kitten food and water at all times. Had we not found Augustus, he would not have survived on his own for long – he had already become thin and must have been very frightened on his own, especially at night with so many predators about. No other kitten prints appeared so we have to assume he was on his own when abandoned or that any siblings didn’t survive. Augustus has since found a lovely home with another cat for company.</p>\n<p>Not far from Beauport, a female cat and one of her kittens were found on a private property near one of our feeding sites close to the cliffs. The Animal Shelter collected them both but the owners of the property then heard about our work with feral cats and contacted us the following day as two more kittens were found. Poppy, a dilute tortie and her brother Morse who is black were about 10 weeks old. A couple of weeks later the Animal Shelter asked us if we would take on the mum and other female sibling, Dotty, to join the 2 we already had. The mum Dash, who is a very pretty tortie and white was about 10 months old and although a little nervous was not feral. A couple of weeks later a black and white female, Cody, around the same age as Dash and with the same very distinctive black markings on her nose was also caught at the same place. Like Dash she was not feral so we think these two are sisters and were abandoned several months ago.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of October we had a call from a couple who had found two beautiful tabby kittens in their garden - literally overnight. There were very few neighbours in this remote lane in the centre of the Island and no one had any idea where they had come from. They were about 14 weeks old and despite being scared were completely at ease once we had trapped them and been handled. Sadly this had to be another case of unwanted kittens but lucky for them, the couple who found them have since adopted them.</p>\n<p>Mid October Nikki was told about some kittens that were seen playing on the golf course near the Five Mile Road. Over the course of a few days and nights we trapped 4 kittens all black and white and mum Yani, a very sweet black and white cat around 10 months old. The kittens were between 7 and 8 weeks old as their eyes were just turning from blue to their permanent colour We also caught a young black adult feral who was possibly their dad. The kittens 2 males and 2 females were slightly nervous but were happy to be reunited with their mum. Yani was quite handleable right from the beginning so we have to assume once again that she was dumped as no one claimed her.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the cases we have been made aware of and dealt with. Unfortunately there must be other cats and kittens in various places in the Island where the same thing has happened but we don’t know about. These cats and/or kittens will no doubt start up new feral colonies over time (if they survive) which makes our work never ending.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who supported us for the month of June at Waitrose, St Brelade by choosing us as the charity to receive the green tokens – we received a cheque for £230.00.</p>\n<p>If you have been following us on Facebook or are clients of our vets Allan &amp; Rushton-Taylor you will have seen that Adele Trott who is a popular vet based mainly at St Mary’s surgery did the Itex walk for us this year with her partner James, and raised over £800.00 through sponsorship from clients and friends (see photo in main newsletter). We were delighted, not only that they chose our charity to support, but to have raised this sum of money was wonderful so our sincere thanks to Adele and James for their efforts. The weather for the walk was the worst in years and our hearts went out to them and other walkers for their tenacity in completing such a challenge in adverse conditions.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been a case of hit and miss due to the weather though Jean did various car boots around the Island when the weather was settled. Apart from September we had a stall at the monthly Vintage Fairs in St Aubin during the summer. July especially was a huge success when we raised nearly £500 during the day probably due to the beautiful sunny day we had which encouraged locals and visitors alike to browse around the stalls at leisure. October was another brilliant day with wall to wall sunshine and we raised £400.00. Once again thanks to Arthur and Sue for giving us a free outdoor pitch at these fairs. Unfortunately the twice yearly Antique &amp; Collectible Fair at Trinity which was organised by Jason Cronin has come to an end. We would like to thank Jason for providing a free pitch for us over the years as this was a great opportunity to sell some of our collectibles. We especially did well at the pre Christmas fairs and these events will be missed.</p>\n<p>One afternoon mid August we had a stall at Radier Manor for their open garden in aid of the Animal Shelter but unfortunately the weather wasn’t very kind to us. For most of the afternoon we had our stock under cover and only sold for about an hour and a half raising £140.00.</p>\n<p>One thing we would like to make clear re our (Jersey) policy on not returning feral cats to conservation areas or where there is extensive bird and small animal wild life. We have mentioned before that there are many predators living in the wild and yet the poor feral cat gets the blame for most of the demise of birds etc. We have returned adult feral cats to private properties where they were caught but only if the owners are happy to have them back and to provide food for them plus keep a general eye on them. Recently Jean received a phone call “second hand” saying they understood we were returning cats to the north coast where there is lots of wildlife plus the sheep. This is not true and we cannot understand why someone complained to the National Trust instead of contacting us personally. The cats are highly unlikely to harm the sheep and with the large number of wild ferrets and rats in the Island let alone birds of prey it’s a case of once again, feral cats being blamed for a decline in bird life. In the UK it’s a different story and adult feral cats neutered by CAT ’77 are quite often returned to site. They deal with feral cats in huge numbers with few homes for them to go to so it is their only option as none of our branches put cats to sleep unless they are terminally ill. Feral kittens are always put up for adoption along with domestic strays. The areas they are returned to are mostly urban or in the country usually on farms or small holdings, stables etc and even then they try to find someone to supply food for them on a regular basis. This is possibly where there has been a misunderstanding as the main CAT’77 website states that adult cats are returned to site after neutering and spaying but this does NOT apply in Jersey. This has been mentioned to the Executive Committee at the recent AGM and will be amended stating that Jersey is an exception.</p>\n<p>Once again Lisette and Carole attended the AGM in London at the end of September (at their own expense) and found that our UK colleagues are having the same problems as us. Many cats and kittens are being dumped as well as people exploiting their female cats by allowing them to breed for profit. Kittens are being advertised for sale predominantly through online advertising sites where sadly it is happening here too. People just don’t see the repercussions of letting their cats have a litter, even just one. The usual reply they give is - they have found the kittens good homes - but it doesn’t stop there as the people they went to may let their cats have a litter too and it goes on and on producing hundreds of cats from just one female.</p>\n<p>Although we have been advertising our initiative “Neuterline 2011” at various establishments around the Island including a spot on Channel Television and BBC Radio Jersey we have not had as many people take up our offer as had hoped. This is open to anyone who is on a low income and would like to have their cat spayed/neutered (a donation to our funds if possible would be appreciated) and includes micro-chipping. Please pass this on to anyone you think needs help in this way – they can ring Jean on 631113 and an appointment will be made at our vets at one of 3 different locations around the Island. Own transport is required as we do not have the facilities or the time to take people’s cats to the vet for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again when our Christmas Appeal is up and running. We understand how more and more difficult it gets each year supporting various charities with the economy the way it is these days. We can assure you that any money you can afford to donate to us will be wisely spent. All the money that is raised here stays in the Island. We are very proud of the fact that CAT ’77/HQ have amalgamated the outgoings of all the branches and 92% of funds raised are spent on the actual care of the cats that we all deal with. This includes food, litter and vet bills. We would say that here in Jersey the percentage is probably higher as we don’t have some of the outgoings that the UK branches do.</p>\n<p>Next Spring Jenny and a friend will do a couple of car boots for us selling just clothes but at the moment we have nowhere to store them in dry conditions. Does anyone have a bit of spare space in a dry shed, garage, spare room etc where we could store a few bags of good clothing. They have been packed away neatly and at the moment don’t envisage having more than 3 or 4 bags to store. If you can help, please ring Carole on her mobile - 07797 735077 – thank you.</p>\n<p>In the summer newsletter we mentioned receiving used stamps in the mail for which we incurred extra postage for. We are still receiving these packages so it would be appreciated if you could telephone Jean and she can let you know where they can be dropped off instead of posting.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',4,10),(13,'NewsPage','2012-11-04 18:45:20','2012-11-04 18:48:40','winter-newsletter-2010','Winter Newsletter 2010',NULL,'<p>Another busy summer what with fundraising as much as possible and trapping numerous cats and kittens in the wild while trying to find them all good homes which has been no easy feat this year. There have been so many kittens advertised for sale all because people want to make money from their female cats. We have heard all the excuses for allowing females to have litters apart from monetary profit i.e. a) wanting their children to experience seeing their cats give birth (most cats give birth in the middle of the night!) b) wanting their cats to have “just one” litter c) because friends have said what beautiful kittens she would have and they would like one d) because they never have a problem finding them good homes. Checking a local advertising website, we have noticed the selling price for kittens starts off high and over the weeks the same people reduce the price because they just cannot find homes for them. So what happens to all these kittens that are getting bigger and bigger with no homes to go to? Some are being taken to the shelter and some have been brought to us, but we fear some are being dumped (see below). Educating people on getting their female cats spayed is so important. If you know of anyone on a low income who needs help in having their cats spayed/neutered please tell them to ring Jean on 631113 and we will help rather than have another kitten explosion next year.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Four delightful 7 week old tabby and white kittens were discovered in a hedge where there were no properties nearby. We were contacted by a caring member of the public and they were brought to us. They were not feral and there was no sign of their mum. They were homed in pairs to loving homes but we will never know what became of their mum.</p>\n<p>Dumped- Two 8 week old kittens (brother and sister) were found in the back of a truck full of rubbish near town. Thankfully they were found by one of our supporters who brought them to us. They were frightened but were not feral. Despite checking the area over the next couple of days no other kittens or mum were found.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Five 7 week old kittens on Jean’s door step! These 3 female and 2 male tabbies and tabby/torties were in a short sided fruit box sitting quietly in the drizzle early November. We don’t know if there were any more than 5 or possibly mum too but they could easily have climbed out of the box. It is not known how long they had been there as no one saw them being left. “Going to the mainland please find homes, thank you” was written on the bottom of the box.</p>\n<p>Dumped - A young black &amp; white domestic female was trapped at one of our north coast sites but discovering she was feeding kittens had to be released back to the area. Perdita was very thin so was fed twice a day with lots of cat food, fish, chicken and cat milk. She was always hungry and would eat everything we gave her including biscuits that were left for her in a feeding box. The area was covered in gorse, brambles and steep valleys of ferns so was impossible to find the kittens. She always came when called but each time would appear from a different direction and after eating would disappear into the thick undergrowth making it impossible to follow her. We hoped she would eventually bring the kittens to us but it took 4 weeks to find them. She was an extremely affectionate cat and one evening after eating instead of retreating into the undergrowth she ran off through a grassy field but kept stopping, looking back and crying. She wasn’t happy till Carole followed her down a steep cotil and began to “call” into ferns at the side of the cotil. Suddenly 2 black and white kittens emerged from amongst all the greenery. By this time they were about 9 weeks old, already feral and were having nothing to do with Carole despite Perdi encouraging them to come to her – they had to be caught with our humane traps.</p>\n<p>Perdi was spayed and has now got a very loving home but despite her kittens, Baby Pingu and Cadpig being socialised for a few weeks we are still to find homes for them. Baby Pingu is the image of Pingu, the black and white feral cat we trapped in April in exactly the same area and we are sure he is their father which means Perdi was dumped before getting pregnant. Cadpig is just like his mum. They are very sweet kittens and we would love to find them a loving home together.</p>\n<p>A black &amp; white female (feral) was trapped on a private property with her two kittens, Cash and Fraser who were about 3 months old. Mum, Evonne, was spayed and returned to the owners of the property who were happy to keep feeding her. Cash a black &amp; white female and Fraser who is tabby are still looking for homes. Another black &amp; white cat was also trapped on a private property with her two kittens. The kittens, Tara and Pookie were around 3-4 months old and unfortunately mum Julieca was pregnant again. She was an abandoned domestic and has since given birth to five black kittens. Tara and Pookie have found a home together and Julieca is being fostered with her kittens till they are old enough to be rehomed.</p>\n<p>Belvedere, a black cat had been living rough in a small garden of a hotel car park where he spent most of his days under bushes. We were alerted to his plight by a couple who had started feeding him daily along with Lisette’s help. We noticed a very nasty sore on his head which needed to be seen to but trying to catch him proved difficult. He was extremely nervous, wouldn’t let us get close to him and kept well away from our traps. Eventually he was caught by hand and quickly put into a basket by the gentleman who had been feeding him but he was so badly scratched he had to go to A &amp; E for a tetanus injection. Once contained in a pen at Jean’s he proved to be a real sweetie so we hate to think what sort of treatment he had received in the past to have been so scared of everyone who tried to help him. Belvedere had a very badly infected wart on his head which had to be removed. He is now a much happier cat and needs a loving home. He has not been claimed so we must assume he was abandoned as well as there were no records of him as a missing cat.</p>\n<p>A call from a member of the public had us setting up feeding sites and trapping at Noirmont. A very small black kitten had been seen by several people near one of the car parks until it was chased by a Jack Russell dog. Apparently it was very tiny and was seen in the daytime. It was trying to eat some bread that had been put for it. We think it may have been dumped as a feral mum would still be feeding kittens at such a young age and there would be no need for a kitten to scavenge for food. Despite setting traps on many occasions we have not found it and we fear the worst especially if it is as young as we suspect. When we were first told about the kitten the weather was terrible with flooding and heavy rains but it was not all in vain as we did trap a grey and white feral kitten around 12 weeks old, Helmut, and an adult black male, Manfred. Manfred has had contact with humans as he is not as nervous as a true feral. These have now been neutered and looking for a home. Helmut’s mum still needs trapping as she was seen at the same time Carole first spotted Helmut in the gorse. She too is grey and white. We will persevere as long as we keep seeing evidence that kittens and cats are living wild in this area.</p>\n<p>One of our north coast sites is still producing cats and kittens just when we thought we had it all under control. In July a man contacted us to say he had seen a ginger mum run across the cliff path with three kittens in tow and disappear down the cliff face. Two were torties and one little ginger just like mum. We already had two other feeding places further along the cliff path which we’d kept going “just in case” but we set up another feeding box closer to where they were seen with kitten biscuits. We trapped mum, (Sweet) Cicely and five kittens, four of them being torties and the little ginger boy. Two of the torties, Cassia and (Star) Anise have found loving homes plus the ginger boy, Jalapeno. The remaining two, Penny (Royal) and (Spicy) Olida are still looking for that forever home. We are monitoring the area very closely for any others that may still be there.</p>\n<p>Since our last newsletter we have found three domestic cats that were microchipped and been missing for some time. Unbelievably their owners didn’t want them back! Thankfully this wasn’t the case with Millie. At the end of October we were contacted by staff of a business in St John, telling us about a little white cat that was roaming the property but she had no ears. She appeared nervous and apparently they had seen her sleeping on the cushioned seat of a fork lift but were unable to get close to her. With a bit of detective work we were able to trace Millie’s owners and it appeared she had been missing for 6 weeks from her home a couple of miles away. A few months previously she had an operation to remove her ear tips due to cancer. Although the owners came and looked for her they were unable to find her. Two days later on the Sunday morning 3 traps were set around the property and checked regularly through the day. Finally late afternoon Millie was trapped much to the delight of her owners who came immediately to collect her. She looked a sorry sight as she was very dirty and her ears were congealed with blood. A trip to the vet next day had her cleaned up and put on a special diet as she was very weak and had lost 1½ kg in weight. She was completely exhausted and the vet said she would not have had the strength to find her way home. All she wanted was lots of cuddles and we hope with all the TLC she is receiving she will make a full recovery.</p>\n<p>Many people who adopt cats from us are reluctant to adopt an older cat but a few years ago Pauline T. and family took on one of our oldies aged 17 as a foster cat. Sooty passed away this year having reached the grand old age of 25! Of course we were all sad to hear of her passing but so pleased she had a happy retirement and not been overlooked because of her age. Saffron is another “older” cat who belies her years, all 17 ½ of them – visitors to Jean’s home cannot believe the age of this active tortie as she runs around the place saying hello to everyone who visits. .</p>\n<p>Over the years we have been called out to all parts of the island to rescue a feral cat but never to Elizabeth castle. Jean had a call from the caretaker saying their resident feral cat (not from us) seemed very poorly and was hiding in an enclosed area but they couldn’t catch her. The Animal Shelter had suggested he contact us. Armed with a cage Jean went across on the Dukw and within a few minutes was able to corner the old cat and get her into the cage. Unfortunately she had a large tumour in her mouth which must have been causing her distress and was taken straight to the vets where our vet decided that euthanasia was the kindest thing. While in the waiting room a call was received from someone who had four 3 week old kittens looking for a foster mum. The kittens were from a farm and their mum had either abandoned them or may have come to harm. It is unusual for a feral cat to abandon her kittens but these needed a substitute mum quickly as 2 of them were very weak. Wendy one of our disclaimed domestic cats who had given birth in our care to 6 kittens 3 weeks earlier was chosen as their new mum. She accepted them immediately but despite her loving care, sadly the two weakest kittens didn’t survive. Her little brood of 8 have thrived and the other kittens accepted their new brother and sister.</p>\n<p>In one of our previous newsletters we wrote about Ebony, an old black cat that had moved around St Ouen for many years and finally found her niche in an area below Grantez. She was regularly fed by Carole and Sam but then luckily a lady Carole knew moved into one of the few properties in this area. Ebony soon came to know that this other Sam was her new feeder and we are grateful to Sam P for feeding Ebony for many months. Springtime, Ebony disappeared and we were all very worried as to what had become of her. One evening several weeks later, we received an anxious call from Sam telling us that Ebony had turned up but looked very unwell and was extremely thin. We went straight away with a trap baiting it with roasted chicken and thankfully it didn’t take long to trap her. Unfortunately Ebony was going into kidney failure and was put to sleep to save any more suffering. Ebony lived her life the way she wanted to and though she had gone “walkabout” we really think she returned to her favourite haunt to spend her final days. She is one little feral we will always remember with affection.</p>\n<p>Our AGM in London was held early October and Lisette and Carole attended on behalf of the charity (at their own expense). Once again it proved very enlightening and was well attended by supporters of the charity plus members from 7 of the 9 branches throughout the UK. While we are on the subject of the charity as a whole we would like to re iterate that all the money we raise in Jersey either through fund raising or donations stays in the Island as we are responsible for our own funds. We send our accounts to HQ yearly for auditing by the charity’s auditors and appreciate Jane B’s help here in Jersey in preparing the accounts as Jane is a qualified accountant and does all the work for us voluntarily.</p>\n<p>We are delighted with the commission we have received so far from the website - www.goanddonate.com. As mentioned in our summer newsletter they are a local website who donate 80% of commission received to the user’s nominated charity. So far we have received in the region of £700.00 from flights, hotels etc being booked on their website. Thank you to Islanders who have used the site and nominated us to receive the commission.</p>\n<p>We really appreciate all the cat food that is donated to the food bins in various supermarkets around the Island. This is a great help to us as we have so many cats to feed especially in the winter when cats are hungrier due to the cold and lack of food in the wild. The pregnant and feeding mothers plus kittens that Jean has been looking after in her home this summer have all had healthy appetites as well as the cats that reside with Jean permanently. We have a few places where a colony of cats have been returned to site after spaying and neutering and are fed by the property owner so every few weeks we deliver food to them to help out with the feeding. Without these people we would have had so many more feral cats to find homes for so thank you to Jo, Rosemary, Grace, Helen and Keith for taking on some of these feral cats. A lot of these cats are now entering their homes as they become more domesticated.</p>\n<p>We are happy to welcome Nikki back on board helping us with the trapping after an absence of a few years. It makes all the difference if there are a few of us who are experienced at trapping as it can be a very tiring and time consuming job and at night we always trap in twos at least.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been successful with Jean and Jenny continuing to do car boots on a regular basis thanks to the generosity of our supporters who donate items for us to sell. We raised around £1,500 during the summer months at the monthly vintage fairs in St Aubin where we had an outdoor pitch. August was a complete washout with continual rain and Lisette, Pat P. and Carole braved the elements under a borrowed gazebo selling china only but got absolutely drenched. They think they made more money out of pity than actually selling items! Thanks to Arthur and Sue who run the fairs for giving us a free pitch again this year.</p>\n<p>The Antiques &amp; Collectible fair in May was a tremendous success when more than £1,200 was raised over the weekend. The next fair will be on Saturday and Sunday 27th and 28th November and we hope to have a repeat performance as there won’t be any more fund raising events till Spring. Thanks to Jason Cronin who organises the fairs for allowing us free space each time.</p>\n<p>Jayne and Kathleen had a stall at the Steam Fair Museum in September which is another good opportunity to promote our charity. Thanks to Kathleen for making her lovely marmalade, we believe it was a sell out.</p>\n<p>Jean Falk, Jayne Plain, Carole Georgelin, Sam Gotel, Lisette Le Creurer and Paula Gibson</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,3,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,10),(14,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:25','2012-11-04 19:27:33','cat-health','Cat Health',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,9),(15,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:52','2012-11-04 18:55:18','feral-care','Feral Care',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,9),(16,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:00:18','2012-11-04 19:27:18','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,14),(17,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:01:08','2012-11-04 19:01:33','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',2,15),(18,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:32:10','jeans-feline-family','Jean\'s Feline Family',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',6,0),(19,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 19:46:04','2012-11-04 19:50:05','maggie-may','Maggie May',NULL,'<p>When Maggie May was born out in the wild she had her umbilical cord twisted around her back leg.

As soon as we could we had her spayed and the complete stump removed, it was full of pus. She must have felt so much better and was soon hopping around.</p>\n<p>She was quickly adopted by a family with other much older cats however Maggie May turned out to be a bit of a bully, so she had to return as she was upsetting the more sedate members of the household.

He lived very happily there for some years until the property was due to be sold due to bereavement. Of course the cats then needed to be caught and removed.</p>\n<p>We duly collected Jay and 5 other cats. At that time he had no name but due to the fact that when he was in the car we could smell Jeyes fluid he earned the name Jay. On our journey back from the farm he started breathing very heavily and collapsed onto his side in the carrying box. Fearing the worst we drove straight up to the vet, it turned out to be a torn diaphragm and he needed emergency surgery to correct it and push all his organs back in the right place. It was a tense situation but he pulled through and was then rehomed.</p>\n<p>During this time we had noticed that he had problems with both his ears-they kept filling up with debris causing him some discomfort. A vet at the time operated on both ears to seal them up which he hoped would help the problem. Sadly this was only a brief respite and he kept having problems. Unfortunately around this time he managed to run away from his home and although very close his owners did not try to retrieve him. We stepped in to try and catch him but he proved very elusive and a number of members of the public who kindly tried to help ended up in casualty with cat bites (myself included!).</p>\n<p>However eventually we caught him in one of our traps. Obviously he was not going back to his old home so we managed to find him a new home with Ivan, whose previous companion had died. After a few spits and spats they settled down and were very happy together. Let no one tell you that you cannot introduce older cats – Ivan and Jay were both over 10 years old.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately his ear problems still plagued him and he was needing regular steroid injections which were not an ideal solution. Discussing this with our vet we decided that the only course of action would be to operate and take out the complete ear canal and sew up the skin making him look like an otter. As the only alternative would be to put him to sleep we agreed and he duly had the operation.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the photo he is a very happy cat now-his owner has said that his whole mood has improved. It was so successful that his brother Compton, who suffered the same problem has had the same operation with fantastic results. Compton is also FIV positive and apart from a few minor problems is also a happier cat. The operations took place in Summer 2008.</p>\n<p>We feel Jay is making very good use of his 9 lives!</p>\n<p>Sadly Jay\'s cat friend Ivan died of age related problems and Jay was unhappy being on his own so he has come back to live with the other cats where he is very happy and loves Prince the dog.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,7,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(26,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:04:22','2012-11-04 20:04:52','saffron','Saffron',NULL,'<p>Saffron is now well into her 21st year and is a permanent resident with Jean-she loves to meet everyone who visits.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(27,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:06:11','2012-11-04 20:06:41','bonnie','Bonnie',NULL,'<p>Bonnie is now a permanent resident due to her health but is very happy with the other cats.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(28,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 20:11:27','2012-11-04 20:38:45','success-stories','Success Stories',NULL,'<p>Here are all the cats we have rehomed since 2010.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,12,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',4,0),(29,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:12:53','2012-11-04 20:33:52','beau','Beau',NULL,'<p>Beau has found a fantastic home with a lovely family in the country.

Kiwi and Coco got off to a rocky start, with Kiwi fleeing from the sight of her, but she eventually won him over and they can seen cuddling and grooming each other all the time.</p>\n<p>From time to time Coco can still have her moments where she\'ll seem to forget who you are and cower, but this is happening less and less. She spends most of her time rolling around on peoples laps squeaking for pats.

It was wonderful to see them settled in their new homes in pairs and a few went to homes with an existing cat for company. I feel it must be really lonely for one kitten on its own in a flat. Instead of playing with a companion it will destroy the furnishings!</p>\n<p>We have had many domestic cats brought to us for re-homing sadly due to a wide range of circumstances, luckily we were able to re-home many of them but as soon as they moved on to their new families more would arrive. Sadly many people seem to see cats as short term pets wanting to pass them on after a few years. With cats now living quite happily into their late teens or early twenties because of improved vet care it is a worrying situation.</p>\n<p>On the weekend of the Antiques Fair at the end of November, Jersey was hit by a snowstorm and the sale closed early as everyone was worried about driving in the snow. Jersey is not used to this! On the Sunday the roads were icy and again the fair closed early. Amazingly we still raised over £840! Needless to say the cats were not amused by the snow and had to be kept cosy with microwaveable heat pads!</p>\n<p>Due to the very cold conditions trapping has been very slow so it has been a good time to home some of the cats from the end of summer. No sooner did most of the younger ferals find permanent homes then three pairs of older cats arrived. They were all cats I had homed before and they were returning due to various reasons. I would like to ask people to consider taking on the older cats as they are so loving and gentle, they can be a good option for people who may not want to be committed to 20 years of cat care. It is sad when people insist on taking kittens, because an older cat may die and then pass on those same cats in a couple of years!</p>\n<p>To update last newsletters story on FIV cats:</p>\n<p>Piper and River have both found lovely homes and have settled very well into their indoor life.</p>\n<p>Spider and Squeak are lovely 12 year old brothers who lost their home on the death of their owner.

They have either been abandoned, unclaimed strays or cats and kittens disclaimed to us. A lot of the disclaimers have been in pairs and it has not been easy trying to find them good homes.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the main newsletter we still have young feral cats looking for homes that we trapped last year. Some of these were only 3 months old when we first had them and 12 months on they are still with us. Nikki has kindly taken on Cash and Fraser for the time being, not only to give Jean a bit more space but to give them a bit of one to one as these 2 lovely cats, brother and sister, were trapped a year ago on a private property with their mum. Mum was returned where she is fed by the owner but her offspring have yet to find that forever home. Though a little nervous they have become very affectionate and sleep on Nikki’s bed at night with her own cats. Owlett and Howlett, two black and white brother and sister caught last December are also still looking for a home.</p>\n<p>One ex feral kitten we homed last summer to be a friend to a kitten that was obtained privately came back to us recently plus the kitten she had been living with. This must be what they call two for the price of one! The reason was an apparent allergy with a member of the family. The ex feral kitten is now friendlier than her domestic companion and both found a lovely new home together.</p>\n<p>Fozzy Bear was another unwanted cat. She had lived at a large country property all her life but at the age of 6 years her original owners moved and asked for the new owners to look after her. Sadly we were asked to take her in as apparently she scared their horse with her miaowing and yet we saw neighbouring cats in the vicinity so hope they are silent around the horse! Thankfully due to the television/radio coverage we received in August, she found a lovely home with a large garden as an only cat and is very much loved by her new owners.</p>\n<p>We had to set up a new feeding site late July at Val de la Mare reservoir after a young cat was seen on one of the paths. It proved quite difficult to trap in this area as it was so close to the path that dogs kept discovering the feeding box hidden in ferns and sloe bushes and tipping it over to try and reach the biscuits. Once the ferns died off at the end of summer we had no sustainable cover which meant moving the feeding box to where there was a bit more undergrowth. Initially it was quite a walk to get to the spot but luckily we found a short-cut which meant only an 8 minute walk instead of 20 although it did incur climbing many steps and a very steep slope. A walk around the reservoir is very pleasurable under normal circumstances but at night when carrying traps, sacking to cover them with, food etc it’s a different story. (See article in main newsletter).</p>\n<p>We then heard the news that the reservoir was to be closed for 12 weeks due to the general public not observing the safety notices posted along the reservoir which was a complete blow to us. After a few phone calls and meetings we obtained permission from Jersey Water and the Security people involved to keep feeding and trapping at the reservoir. This was music to our ears. We would like to thank Mr Snowden and Mr Morris from Jersey Water and G4 for their co-operation in letting us continue our work during this period.</p>\n<p>While trapping at the reservoir we helped to find a missing cat called Tails who had been missing for 7 months and lived about a mile away. Tails was an enormous 9 year old dark ginger cat and went missing while his owners were on holiday. It was wonderful to see Tails back home with his caring owners as he had been very much missed by his family.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it seems to be another year for picking up dumped cats and kittens – it appears that no amount of advertising in English and other languages spoken in the Island, stating that this is an unacceptable way of “disposing” of unwanted kittens, seems to be making any difference at all which is very disheartening. Even offering to help with spaying and neutering is being ignored. Unfortunately the following stories prove this.</p>\n<p>In the main newsletter we mention Daisy, a very pretty pale grey tabby kitten that was knocked down in the middle of a road leading off the Five Mile Road. She was only about 9 weeks old but miraculously survived. Initially it was thought she was a feral as she was quite “lively” but once in a loving home environment with plenty of attention she became completely at ease and within a few days was playing like any normal kitten of her age. She was a domestic kitten that had been dumped as she could not have got to where she was found by herself at that age and no others were found in the vicinity. Daisy is certainly one very lucky kitten to have been found by caring people who were actually prepared to give her a loving home. You can see the most delightful pictures of her on our Facebook page.</p>\n<p>We are sure that Lottie was abandoned as she was never claimed despite advertising her as found. She was black and white, under a year old, considerably thin, had no microchip and had not been spayed. Concerned CAT’77 supporters had been watching her around an allotment for some time and were sure she had no home to go to so eventually brought her to us. She has since found a lovely home with the family that found her.</p>\n<p>We continued feeding at Noirmont Point throughout the year as cat paw prints were still appearing in the sand. Late August Sam went to top up the biscuits one morning and luckily spotted a small black kitten near one of the bunkers as it ran into the gorse. Within the next 48 hours we trapped this beautiful little black boy who was between 8 and 9 weeks old and once again definitely not a feral. He was scared but once he realised he was safe he happily let us stroke him once back at Jean’s. We needed to be sure there were no other siblings so monitored the site for a few weeks looking out for tiny paw prints and leaving kitten food and water at all times. Had we not found Augustus, he would not have survived on his own for long – he had already become thin and must have been very frightened on his own, especially at night with so many predators about. No other kitten prints appeared so we have to assume he was on his own when abandoned or that any siblings didn’t survive. Augustus has since found a lovely home with another cat for company.</p>\n<p>Not far from Beauport, a female cat and one of her kittens were found on a private property near one of our feeding sites close to the cliffs. The Animal Shelter collected them both but the owners of the property then heard about our work with feral cats and contacted us the following day as two more kittens were found. Poppy, a dilute tortie and her brother Morse who is black were about 10 weeks old. A couple of weeks later the Animal Shelter asked us if we would take on the mum and other female sibling, Dotty, to join the 2 we already had. The mum Dash, who is a very pretty tortie and white was about 10 months old and although a little nervous was not feral. A couple of weeks later a black and white female, Cody, around the same age as Dash and with the same very distinctive black markings on her nose was also caught at the same place. Like Dash she was not feral so we think these two are sisters and were abandoned several months ago.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of October we had a call from a couple who had found two beautiful tabby kittens in their garden - literally overnight. There were very few neighbours in this remote lane in the centre of the Island and no one had any idea where they had come from. They were about 14 weeks old and despite being scared were completely at ease once we had trapped them and been handled. Sadly this had to be another case of unwanted kittens but lucky for them, the couple who found them have since adopted them.</p>\n<p>Mid October Nikki was told about some kittens that were seen playing on the golf course near the Five Mile Road. Over the course of a few days and nights we trapped 4 kittens all black and white and mum Yani, a very sweet black and white cat around 10 months old. The kittens were between 7 and 8 weeks old as their eyes were just turning from blue to their permanent colour We also caught a young black adult feral who was possibly their dad. The kittens 2 males and 2 females were slightly nervous but were happy to be reunited with their mum. Yani was quite handleable right from the beginning so we have to assume once again that she was dumped as no one claimed her.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the cases we have been made aware of and dealt with. Unfortunately there must be other cats and kittens in various places in the Island where the same thing has happened but we don’t know about. These cats and/or kittens will no doubt start up new feral colonies over time (if they survive) which makes our work never ending.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who supported us for the month of June at Waitrose, St Brelade by choosing us as the charity to receive the green tokens – we received a cheque for £230.00.</p>\n<p>If you have been following us on Facebook or are clients of our vets Allan &amp; Rushton-Taylor you will have seen that Adele Trott who is a popular vet based mainly at St Mary’s surgery did the Itex walk for us this year with her partner James, and raised over £800.00 through sponsorship from clients and friends (see photo in main newsletter). We were delighted, not only that they chose our charity to support, but to have raised this sum of money was wonderful so our sincere thanks to Adele and James for their efforts. The weather for the walk was the worst in years and our hearts went out to them and other walkers for their tenacity in completing such a challenge in adverse conditions.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been a case of hit and miss due to the weather though Jean did various car boots around the Island when the weather was settled. Apart from September we had a stall at the monthly Vintage Fairs in St Aubin during the summer. July especially was a huge success when we raised nearly £500 during the day probably due to the beautiful sunny day we had which encouraged locals and visitors alike to browse around the stalls at leisure. October was another brilliant day with wall to wall sunshine and we raised £400.00. Once again thanks to Arthur and Sue for giving us a free outdoor pitch at these fairs. Unfortunately the twice yearly Antique &amp; Collectible Fair at Trinity which was organised by Jason Cronin has come to an end. We would like to thank Jason for providing a free pitch for us over the years as this was a great opportunity to sell some of our collectibles. We especially did well at the pre Christmas fairs and these events will be missed.</p>\n<p>One afternoon mid August we had a stall at Radier Manor for their open garden in aid of the Animal Shelter but unfortunately the weather wasn’t very kind to us. For most of the afternoon we had our stock under cover and only sold for about an hour and a half raising £140.00.</p>\n<p>One thing we would like to make clear re our (Jersey) policy on not returning feral cats to conservation areas or where there is extensive bird and small animal wild life. We have mentioned before that there are many predators living in the wild and yet the poor feral cat gets the blame for most of the demise of birds etc. We have returned adult feral cats to private properties where they were caught but only if the owners are happy to have them back and to provide food for them plus keep a general eye on them. Recently Jean received a phone call “second hand” saying they understood we were returning cats to the north coast where there is lots of wildlife plus the sheep. This is not true and we cannot understand why someone complained to the National Trust instead of contacting us personally. The cats are highly unlikely to harm the sheep and with the large number of wild ferrets and rats in the Island let alone birds of prey it’s a case of once again, feral cats being blamed for a decline in bird life. In the UK it’s a different story and adult feral cats neutered by CAT ’77 are quite often returned to site. They deal with feral cats in huge numbers with few homes for them to go to so it is their only option as none of our branches put cats to sleep unless they are terminally ill. Feral kittens are always put up for adoption along with domestic strays. The areas they are returned to are mostly urban or in the country usually on farms or small holdings, stables etc and even then they try to find someone to supply food for them on a regular basis. This is possibly where there has been a misunderstanding as the main CAT’77 website states that adult cats are returned to site after neutering and spaying but this does NOT apply in Jersey. This has been mentioned to the Executive Committee at the recent AGM and will be amended stating that Jersey is an exception.</p>\n<p>Once again Lisette and Carole attended the AGM in London at the end of September (at their own expense) and found that our UK colleagues are having the same problems as us. Many cats and kittens are being dumped as well as people exploiting their female cats by allowing them to breed for profit. Kittens are being advertised for sale predominantly through online advertising sites where sadly it is happening here too. People just don’t see the repercussions of letting their cats have a litter, even just one. The usual reply they give is - they have found the kittens good homes - but it doesn’t stop there as the people they went to may let their cats have a litter too and it goes on and on producing hundreds of cats from just one female.</p>\n<p>Although we have been advertising our initiative “Neuterline 2011” at various establishments around the Island including a spot on Channel Television and BBC Radio Jersey we have not had as many people take up our offer as had hoped. This is open to anyone who is on a low income and would like to have their cat spayed/neutered (a donation to our funds if possible would be appreciated) and includes micro-chipping. Please pass this on to anyone you think needs help in this way – they can ring Jean on 631113 and an appointment will be made at our vets at one of 3 different locations around the Island. Own transport is required as we do not have the facilities or the time to take people’s cats to the vet for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again when our Christmas Appeal is up and running. We understand how more and more difficult it gets each year supporting various charities with the economy the way it is these days. We can assure you that any money you can afford to donate to us will be wisely spent. All the money that is raised here stays in the Island. We are very proud of the fact that CAT ’77/HQ have amalgamated the outgoings of all the branches and 92% of funds raised are spent on the actual care of the cats that we all deal with. This includes food, litter and vet bills. We would say that here in Jersey the percentage is probably higher as we don’t have some of the outgoings that the UK branches do.</p>\n<p>Next Spring Jenny and a friend will do a couple of car boots for us selling just clothes but at the moment we have nowhere to store them in dry conditions. Does anyone have a bit of spare space in a dry shed, garage, spare room etc where we could store a few bags of good clothing. They have been packed away neatly and at the moment don’t envisage having more than 3 or 4 bags to store. If you can help, please ring Carole on her mobile - 07797 735077 – thank you.</p>\n<p>In the summer newsletter we mentioned receiving used stamps in the mail for which we incurred extra postage for. We are still receiving these packages so it would be appreciated if you could telephone Jean and she can let you know where they can be dropped off instead of posting.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',4,10),(13,'NewsPage','2012-11-04 18:45:20','2012-11-04 18:48:40','winter-newsletter-2010','Winter Newsletter 2010',NULL,'<p>Another busy summer what with fundraising as much as possible and trapping numerous cats and kittens in the wild while trying to find them all good homes which has been no easy feat this year. There have been so many kittens advertised for sale all because people want to make money from their female cats. We have heard all the excuses for allowing females to have litters apart from monetary profit i.e. a) wanting their children to experience seeing their cats give birth (most cats give birth in the middle of the night!) b) wanting their cats to have “just one” litter c) because friends have said what beautiful kittens she would have and they would like one d) because they never have a problem finding them good homes. Checking a local advertising website, we have noticed the selling price for kittens starts off high and over the weeks the same people reduce the price because they just cannot find homes for them. So what happens to all these kittens that are getting bigger and bigger with no homes to go to? Some are being taken to the shelter and some have been brought to us, but we fear some are being dumped (see below). Educating people on getting their female cats spayed is so important. If you know of anyone on a low income who needs help in having their cats spayed/neutered please tell them to ring Jean on 631113 and we will help rather than have another kitten explosion next year.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Four delightful 7 week old tabby and white kittens were discovered in a hedge where there were no properties nearby. We were contacted by a caring member of the public and they were brought to us. They were not feral and there was no sign of their mum. They were homed in pairs to loving homes but we will never know what became of their mum.</p>\n<p>Dumped- Two 8 week old kittens (brother and sister) were found in the back of a truck full of rubbish near town. Thankfully they were found by one of our supporters who brought them to us. They were frightened but were not feral. Despite checking the area over the next couple of days no other kittens or mum were found.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Five 7 week old kittens on Jean’s door step! These 3 female and 2 male tabbies and tabby/torties were in a short sided fruit box sitting quietly in the drizzle early November. We don’t know if there were any more than 5 or possibly mum too but they could easily have climbed out of the box. It is not known how long they had been there as no one saw them being left. “Going to the mainland please find homes, thank you” was written on the bottom of the box.</p>\n<p>Dumped - A young black &amp; white domestic female was trapped at one of our north coast sites but discovering she was feeding kittens had to be released back to the area. Perdita was very thin so was fed twice a day with lots of cat food, fish, chicken and cat milk. She was always hungry and would eat everything we gave her including biscuits that were left for her in a feeding box. The area was covered in gorse, brambles and steep valleys of ferns so was impossible to find the kittens. She always came when called but each time would appear from a different direction and after eating would disappear into the thick undergrowth making it impossible to follow her. We hoped she would eventually bring the kittens to us but it took 4 weeks to find them. She was an extremely affectionate cat and one evening after eating instead of retreating into the undergrowth she ran off through a grassy field but kept stopping, looking back and crying. She wasn’t happy till Carole followed her down a steep cotil and began to “call” into ferns at the side of the cotil. Suddenly 2 black and white kittens emerged from amongst all the greenery. By this time they were about 9 weeks old, already feral and were having nothing to do with Carole despite Perdi encouraging them to come to her – they had to be caught with our humane traps.</p>\n<p>Perdi was spayed and has now got a very loving home but despite her kittens, Baby Pingu and Cadpig being socialised for a few weeks we are still to find homes for them. Baby Pingu is the image of Pingu, the black and white feral cat we trapped in April in exactly the same area and we are sure he is their father which means Perdi was dumped before getting pregnant. Cadpig is just like his mum. They are very sweet kittens and we would love to find them a loving home together.</p>\n<p>A black &amp; white female (feral) was trapped on a private property with her two kittens, Cash and Fraser who were about 3 months old. Mum, Evonne, was spayed and returned to the owners of the property who were happy to keep feeding her. Cash a black &amp; white female and Fraser who is tabby are still looking for homes. Another black &amp; white cat was also trapped on a private property with her two kittens. The kittens, Tara and Pookie were around 3-4 months old and unfortunately mum Julieca was pregnant again. She was an abandoned domestic and has since given birth to five black kittens. Tara and Pookie have found a home together and Julieca is being fostered with her kittens till they are old enough to be rehomed.</p>\n<p>Belvedere, a black cat had been living rough in a small garden of a hotel car park where he spent most of his days under bushes. We were alerted to his plight by a couple who had started feeding him daily along with Lisette’s help. We noticed a very nasty sore on his head which needed to be seen to but trying to catch him proved difficult. He was extremely nervous, wouldn’t let us get close to him and kept well away from our traps. Eventually he was caught by hand and quickly put into a basket by the gentleman who had been feeding him but he was so badly scratched he had to go to A &amp; E for a tetanus injection. Once contained in a pen at Jean’s he proved to be a real sweetie so we hate to think what sort of treatment he had received in the past to have been so scared of everyone who tried to help him. Belvedere had a very badly infected wart on his head which had to be removed. He is now a much happier cat and needs a loving home. He has not been claimed so we must assume he was abandoned as well as there were no records of him as a missing cat.</p>\n<p>A call from a member of the public had us setting up feeding sites and trapping at Noirmont. A very small black kitten had been seen by several people near one of the car parks until it was chased by a Jack Russell dog. Apparently it was very tiny and was seen in the daytime. It was trying to eat some bread that had been put for it. We think it may have been dumped as a feral mum would still be feeding kittens at such a young age and there would be no need for a kitten to scavenge for food. Despite setting traps on many occasions we have not found it and we fear the worst especially if it is as young as we suspect. When we were first told about the kitten the weather was terrible with flooding and heavy rains but it was not all in vain as we did trap a grey and white feral kitten around 12 weeks old, Helmut, and an adult black male, Manfred. Manfred has had contact with humans as he is not as nervous as a true feral. These have now been neutered and looking for a home. Helmut’s mum still needs trapping as she was seen at the same time Carole first spotted Helmut in the gorse. She too is grey and white. We will persevere as long as we keep seeing evidence that kittens and cats are living wild in this area.</p>\n<p>One of our north coast sites is still producing cats and kittens just when we thought we had it all under control. In July a man contacted us to say he had seen a ginger mum run across the cliff path with three kittens in tow and disappear down the cliff face. Two were torties and one little ginger just like mum. We already had two other feeding places further along the cliff path which we’d kept going “just in case” but we set up another feeding box closer to where they were seen with kitten biscuits. We trapped mum, (Sweet) Cicely and five kittens, four of them being torties and the little ginger boy. Two of the torties, Cassia and (Star) Anise have found loving homes plus the ginger boy, Jalapeno. The remaining two, Penny (Royal) and (Spicy) Olida are still looking for that forever home. We are monitoring the area very closely for any others that may still be there.</p>\n<p>Since our last newsletter we have found three domestic cats that were microchipped and been missing for some time. Unbelievably their owners didn’t want them back! Thankfully this wasn’t the case with Millie. At the end of October we were contacted by staff of a business in St John, telling us about a little white cat that was roaming the property but she had no ears. She appeared nervous and apparently they had seen her sleeping on the cushioned seat of a fork lift but were unable to get close to her. With a bit of detective work we were able to trace Millie’s owners and it appeared she had been missing for 6 weeks from her home a couple of miles away. A few months previously she had an operation to remove her ear tips due to cancer. Although the owners came and looked for her they were unable to find her. Two days later on the Sunday morning 3 traps were set around the property and checked regularly through the day. Finally late afternoon Millie was trapped much to the delight of her owners who came immediately to collect her. She looked a sorry sight as she was very dirty and her ears were congealed with blood. A trip to the vet next day had her cleaned up and put on a special diet as she was very weak and had lost 1½ kg in weight. She was completely exhausted and the vet said she would not have had the strength to find her way home. All she wanted was lots of cuddles and we hope with all the TLC she is receiving she will make a full recovery.</p>\n<p>Many people who adopt cats from us are reluctant to adopt an older cat but a few years ago Pauline T. and family took on one of our oldies aged 17 as a foster cat. Sooty passed away this year having reached the grand old age of 25! Of course we were all sad to hear of her passing but so pleased she had a happy retirement and not been overlooked because of her age. Saffron is another “older” cat who belies her years, all 17 ½ of them – visitors to Jean’s home cannot believe the age of this active tortie as she runs around the place saying hello to everyone who visits. .</p>\n<p>Over the years we have been called out to all parts of the island to rescue a feral cat but never to Elizabeth castle. Jean had a call from the caretaker saying their resident feral cat (not from us) seemed very poorly and was hiding in an enclosed area but they couldn’t catch her. The Animal Shelter had suggested he contact us. Armed with a cage Jean went across on the Dukw and within a few minutes was able to corner the old cat and get her into the cage. Unfortunately she had a large tumour in her mouth which must have been causing her distress and was taken straight to the vets where our vet decided that euthanasia was the kindest thing. While in the waiting room a call was received from someone who had four 3 week old kittens looking for a foster mum. The kittens were from a farm and their mum had either abandoned them or may have come to harm. It is unusual for a feral cat to abandon her kittens but these needed a substitute mum quickly as 2 of them were very weak. Wendy one of our disclaimed domestic cats who had given birth in our care to 6 kittens 3 weeks earlier was chosen as their new mum. She accepted them immediately but despite her loving care, sadly the two weakest kittens didn’t survive. Her little brood of 8 have thrived and the other kittens accepted their new brother and sister.</p>\n<p>In one of our previous newsletters we wrote about Ebony, an old black cat that had moved around St Ouen for many years and finally found her niche in an area below Grantez. She was regularly fed by Carole and Sam but then luckily a lady Carole knew moved into one of the few properties in this area. Ebony soon came to know that this other Sam was her new feeder and we are grateful to Sam P for feeding Ebony for many months. Springtime, Ebony disappeared and we were all very worried as to what had become of her. One evening several weeks later, we received an anxious call from Sam telling us that Ebony had turned up but looked very unwell and was extremely thin. We went straight away with a trap baiting it with roasted chicken and thankfully it didn’t take long to trap her. Unfortunately Ebony was going into kidney failure and was put to sleep to save any more suffering. Ebony lived her life the way she wanted to and though she had gone “walkabout” we really think she returned to her favourite haunt to spend her final days. She is one little feral we will always remember with affection.</p>\n<p>Our AGM in London was held early October and Lisette and Carole attended on behalf of the charity (at their own expense). Once again it proved very enlightening and was well attended by supporters of the charity plus members from 7 of the 9 branches throughout the UK. While we are on the subject of the charity as a whole we would like to re iterate that all the money we raise in Jersey either through fund raising or donations stays in the Island as we are responsible for our own funds. We send our accounts to HQ yearly for auditing by the charity’s auditors and appreciate Jane B’s help here in Jersey in preparing the accounts as Jane is a qualified accountant and does all the work for us voluntarily.</p>\n<p>We are delighted with the commission we have received so far from the website - www.goanddonate.com. As mentioned in our summer newsletter they are a local website who donate 80% of commission received to the user’s nominated charity. So far we have received in the region of £700.00 from flights, hotels etc being booked on their website. Thank you to Islanders who have used the site and nominated us to receive the commission.</p>\n<p>We really appreciate all the cat food that is donated to the food bins in various supermarkets around the Island. This is a great help to us as we have so many cats to feed especially in the winter when cats are hungrier due to the cold and lack of food in the wild. The pregnant and feeding mothers plus kittens that Jean has been looking after in her home this summer have all had healthy appetites as well as the cats that reside with Jean permanently. We have a few places where a colony of cats have been returned to site after spaying and neutering and are fed by the property owner so every few weeks we deliver food to them to help out with the feeding. Without these people we would have had so many more feral cats to find homes for so thank you to Jo, Rosemary, Grace, Helen and Keith for taking on some of these feral cats. A lot of these cats are now entering their homes as they become more domesticated.</p>\n<p>We are happy to welcome Nikki back on board helping us with the trapping after an absence of a few years. It makes all the difference if there are a few of us who are experienced at trapping as it can be a very tiring and time consuming job and at night we always trap in twos at least.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been successful with Jean and Jenny continuing to do car boots on a regular basis thanks to the generosity of our supporters who donate items for us to sell. We raised around £1,500 during the summer months at the monthly vintage fairs in St Aubin where we had an outdoor pitch. August was a complete washout with continual rain and Lisette, Pat P. and Carole braved the elements under a borrowed gazebo selling china only but got absolutely drenched. They think they made more money out of pity than actually selling items! Thanks to Arthur and Sue who run the fairs for giving us a free pitch again this year.</p>\n<p>The Antiques &amp; Collectible fair in May was a tremendous success when more than £1,200 was raised over the weekend. The next fair will be on Saturday and Sunday 27th and 28th November and we hope to have a repeat performance as there won’t be any more fund raising events till Spring. Thanks to Jason Cronin who organises the fairs for allowing us free space each time.</p>\n<p>Jayne and Kathleen had a stall at the Steam Fair Museum in September which is another good opportunity to promote our charity. Thanks to Kathleen for making her lovely marmalade, we believe it was a sell out.</p>\n<p>Jean Falk, Jayne Plain, Carole Georgelin, Sam Gotel, Lisette Le Creurer and Paula Gibson</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,3,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,10),(14,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:25','2012-11-04 19:27:33','cat-health','Cat Health',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,9),(15,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:52','2012-11-04 18:55:18','feral-care','Feral Care',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,9),(16,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:00:18','2012-11-04 19:27:18','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,14),(17,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:01:08','2012-11-04 19:01:33','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',2,15),(18,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:32:10','jeans-feline-family','Jean\'s Feline Family',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',6,0),(19,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 19:46:04','2012-11-04 19:50:06','maggie-may','Maggie May',NULL,'<p>When Maggie May was born out in the wild she had her umbilical cord twisted around her back leg. Sadly she wasn’t found by us until she was a 6 weeks old kitten and by then the lower part of the leg had fallen off. She was left with a jagged stump which was very swollen and infected and would have been giving her some discomfort every time she steadied herself. As soon as we could we had her spayed and the complete stump removed, it was full of pus. She must have felt so much better and was soon hopping around.</p>\n<p>She was quickly adopted by a family with other much older cats however Maggie May turned out to be a bit of a bully, so she had to return as she was upsetting the more sedate members of the household. She then went out to an older couple with no other animals and stayed for about 6 months before she started bullying them! Another excursion of 14 months ended after she attacked the owner.</p>\n<p>She now lives with me and greets all my visitors and they all fall in love. But I have to tell them she is only lulling them into a false sense of security if they were to adopt her they would end up in casualty!

He lived very happily there for some years until the property was due to be sold due to bereavement. Of course the cats then needed to be caught and removed.</p>\n<p>We duly collected Jay and 5 other cats. At that time he had no name but due to the fact that when he was in the car we could smell Jeyes fluid he earned the name Jay. On our journey back from the farm he started breathing very heavily and collapsed onto his side in the carrying box. Fearing the worst we drove straight up to the vet, it turned out to be a torn diaphragm and he needed emergency surgery to correct it and push all his organs back in the right place. It was a tense situation but he pulled through and was then rehomed.</p>\n<p>During this time we had noticed that he had problems with both his ears-they kept filling up with debris causing him some discomfort. A vet at the time operated on both ears to seal them up which he hoped would help the problem. Sadly this was only a brief respite and he kept having problems. Unfortunately around this time he managed to run away from his home and although very close his owners did not try to retrieve him. We stepped in to try and catch him but he proved very elusive and a number of members of the public who kindly tried to help ended up in casualty with cat bites (myself included!).</p>\n<p>However eventually we caught him in one of our traps. Obviously he was not going back to his old home so we managed to find him a new home with Ivan, whose previous companion had died. After a few spits and spats they settled down and were very happy together. Let no one tell you that you cannot introduce older cats – Ivan and Jay were both over 10 years old.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately his ear problems still plagued him and he was needing regular steroid injections which were not an ideal solution. Discussing this with our vet we decided that the only course of action would be to operate and take out the complete ear canal and sew up the skin making him look like an otter. As the only alternative would be to put him to sleep we agreed and he duly had the operation.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the photo he is a very happy cat now-his owner has said that his whole mood has improved. It was so successful that his brother Compton, who suffered the same problem has had the same operation with fantastic results. Compton is also FIV positive and apart from a few minor problems is also a happier cat. The operations took place in Summer 2008.</p>\n<p>We feel Jay is making very good use of his 9 lives!</p>\n<p>Sadly Jay\'s cat friend Ivan died of age related problems and Jay was unhappy being on his own so he has come back to live with the other cats where he is very happy and loves Prince the dog.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,7,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(26,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:04:22','2012-11-04 20:04:52','saffron','Saffron',NULL,'<p>Saffron is now well into her 21st year and is a permanent resident with Jean-she loves to meet everyone who visits.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(27,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:06:11','2012-11-04 20:06:41','bonnie','Bonnie',NULL,'<p>Bonnie is now a permanent resident due to her health but is very happy with the other cats.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',3,18),(28,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 20:11:27','2012-11-04 20:38:45','success-stories','Success Stories',NULL,'<p>Here are all the cats we have rehomed since 2010.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,12,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',4,0),(29,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:12:53','2012-11-04 20:33:52','beau','Beau',NULL,'<p>Beau has found a fantastic home with a lovely family in the country.

They have either been abandoned, unclaimed strays or cats and kittens disclaimed to us. A lot of the disclaimers have been in pairs and it has not been easy trying to find them good homes.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the main newsletter we still have young feral cats looking for homes that we trapped last year. Some of these were only 3 months old when we first had them and 12 months on they are still with us. Nikki has kindly taken on Cash and Fraser for the time being, not only to give Jean a bit more space but to give them a bit of one to one as these 2 lovely cats, brother and sister, were trapped a year ago on a private property with their mum. Mum was returned where she is fed by the owner but her offspring have yet to find that forever home. Though a little nervous they have become very affectionate and sleep on Nikki’s bed at night with her own cats. Owlett and Howlett, two black and white brother and sister caught last December are also still looking for a home.</p>\n<p>One ex feral kitten we homed last summer to be a friend to a kitten that was obtained privately came back to us recently plus the kitten she had been living with. This must be what they call two for the price of one! The reason was an apparent allergy with a member of the family. The ex feral kitten is now friendlier than her domestic companion and both found a lovely new home together.</p>\n<p>Fozzy Bear was another unwanted cat. She had lived at a large country property all her life but at the age of 6 years her original owners moved and asked for the new owners to look after her. Sadly we were asked to take her in as apparently she scared their horse with her miaowing and yet we saw neighbouring cats in the vicinity so hope they are silent around the horse! Thankfully due to the television/radio coverage we received in August, she found a lovely home with a large garden as an only cat and is very much loved by her new owners.</p>\n<p>We had to set up a new feeding site late July at Val de la Mare reservoir after a young cat was seen on one of the paths. It proved quite difficult to trap in this area as it was so close to the path that dogs kept discovering the feeding box hidden in ferns and sloe bushes and tipping it over to try and reach the biscuits. Once the ferns died off at the end of summer we had no sustainable cover which meant moving the feeding box to where there was a bit more undergrowth. Initially it was quite a walk to get to the spot but luckily we found a short-cut which meant only an 8 minute walk instead of 20 although it did incur climbing many steps and a very steep slope. A walk around the reservoir is very pleasurable under normal circumstances but at night when carrying traps, sacking to cover them with, food etc it’s a different story. (See article in main newsletter).</p>\n<p>We then heard the news that the reservoir was to be closed for 12 weeks due to the general public not observing the safety notices posted along the reservoir which was a complete blow to us. After a few phone calls and meetings we obtained permission from Jersey Water and the Security people involved to keep feeding and trapping at the reservoir. This was music to our ears. We would like to thank Mr Snowden and Mr Morris from Jersey Water and G4 for their co-operation in letting us continue our work during this period.</p>\n<p>While trapping at the reservoir we helped to find a missing cat called Tails who had been missing for 7 months and lived about a mile away. Tails was an enormous 9 year old dark ginger cat and went missing while his owners were on holiday. It was wonderful to see Tails back home with his caring owners as he had been very much missed by his family.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately it seems to be another year for picking up dumped cats and kittens – it appears that no amount of advertising in English and other languages spoken in the Island, stating that this is an unacceptable way of “disposing” of unwanted kittens, seems to be making any difference at all which is very disheartening. Even offering to help with spaying and neutering is being ignored. Unfortunately the following stories prove this.</p>\n<p>In the main newsletter we mention Daisy, a very pretty pale grey tabby kitten that was knocked down in the middle of a road leading off the Five Mile Road. She was only about 9 weeks old but miraculously survived. Initially it was thought she was a feral as she was quite “lively” but once in a loving home environment with plenty of attention she became completely at ease and within a few days was playing like any normal kitten of her age. She was a domestic kitten that had been dumped as she could not have got to where she was found by herself at that age and no others were found in the vicinity. Daisy is certainly one very lucky kitten to have been found by caring people who were actually prepared to give her a loving home. You can see the most delightful pictures of her on our Facebook page.</p>\n<p>We are sure that Lottie was abandoned as she was never claimed despite advertising her as found. She was black and white, under a year old, considerably thin, had no microchip and had not been spayed. Concerned CAT’77 supporters had been watching her around an allotment for some time and were sure she had no home to go to so eventually brought her to us. She has since found a lovely home with the family that found her.</p>\n<p>We continued feeding at Noirmont Point throughout the year as cat paw prints were still appearing in the sand. Late August Sam went to top up the biscuits one morning and luckily spotted a small black kitten near one of the bunkers as it ran into the gorse. Within the next 48 hours we trapped this beautiful little black boy who was between 8 and 9 weeks old and once again definitely not a feral. He was scared but once he realised he was safe he happily let us stroke him once back at Jean’s. We needed to be sure there were no other siblings so monitored the site for a few weeks looking out for tiny paw prints and leaving kitten food and water at all times. Had we not found Augustus, he would not have survived on his own for long – he had already become thin and must have been very frightened on his own, especially at night with so many predators about. No other kitten prints appeared so we have to assume he was on his own when abandoned or that any siblings didn’t survive. Augustus has since found a lovely home with another cat for company.</p>\n<p>Not far from Beauport, a female cat and one of her kittens were found on a private property near one of our feeding sites close to the cliffs. The Animal Shelter collected them both but the owners of the property then heard about our work with feral cats and contacted us the following day as two more kittens were found. Poppy, a dilute tortie and her brother Morse who is black were about 10 weeks old. A couple of weeks later the Animal Shelter asked us if we would take on the mum and other female sibling, Dotty, to join the 2 we already had. The mum Dash, who is a very pretty tortie and white was about 10 months old and although a little nervous was not feral. A couple of weeks later a black and white female, Cody, around the same age as Dash and with the same very distinctive black markings on her nose was also caught at the same place. Like Dash she was not feral so we think these two are sisters and were abandoned several months ago.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of October we had a call from a couple who had found two beautiful tabby kittens in their garden - literally overnight. There were very few neighbours in this remote lane in the centre of the Island and no one had any idea where they had come from. They were about 14 weeks old and despite being scared were completely at ease once we had trapped them and been handled. Sadly this had to be another case of unwanted kittens but lucky for them, the couple who found them have since adopted them.</p>\n<p>Mid October Nikki was told about some kittens that were seen playing on the golf course near the Five Mile Road. Over the course of a few days and nights we trapped 4 kittens all black and white and mum Yani, a very sweet black and white cat around 10 months old. The kittens were between 7 and 8 weeks old as their eyes were just turning from blue to their permanent colour We also caught a young black adult feral who was possibly their dad. The kittens 2 males and 2 females were slightly nervous but were happy to be reunited with their mum. Yani was quite handleable right from the beginning so we have to assume once again that she was dumped as no one claimed her.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the cases we have been made aware of and dealt with. Unfortunately there must be other cats and kittens in various places in the Island where the same thing has happened but we don’t know about. These cats and/or kittens will no doubt start up new feral colonies over time (if they survive) which makes our work never ending.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who supported us for the month of June at Waitrose, St Brelade by choosing us as the charity to receive the green tokens – we received a cheque for £230.00.</p>\n<p>If you have been following us on Facebook or are clients of our vets Allan &amp; Rushton-Taylor you will have seen that Adele Trott who is a popular vet based mainly at St Mary’s surgery did the Itex walk for us this year with her partner James, and raised over £800.00 through sponsorship from clients and friends (see photo in main newsletter). We were delighted, not only that they chose our charity to support, but to have raised this sum of money was wonderful so our sincere thanks to Adele and James for their efforts. The weather for the walk was the worst in years and our hearts went out to them and other walkers for their tenacity in completing such a challenge in adverse conditions.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been a case of hit and miss due to the weather though Jean did various car boots around the Island when the weather was settled. Apart from September we had a stall at the monthly Vintage Fairs in St Aubin during the summer. July especially was a huge success when we raised nearly £500 during the day probably due to the beautiful sunny day we had which encouraged locals and visitors alike to browse around the stalls at leisure. October was another brilliant day with wall to wall sunshine and we raised £400.00. Once again thanks to Arthur and Sue for giving us a free outdoor pitch at these fairs. Unfortunately the twice yearly Antique &amp; Collectible Fair at Trinity which was organised by Jason Cronin has come to an end. We would like to thank Jason for providing a free pitch for us over the years as this was a great opportunity to sell some of our collectibles. We especially did well at the pre Christmas fairs and these events will be missed.</p>\n<p>One afternoon mid August we had a stall at Radier Manor for their open garden in aid of the Animal Shelter but unfortunately the weather wasn’t very kind to us. For most of the afternoon we had our stock under cover and only sold for about an hour and a half raising £140.00.</p>\n<p>One thing we would like to make clear re our (Jersey) policy on not returning feral cats to conservation areas or where there is extensive bird and small animal wild life. We have mentioned before that there are many predators living in the wild and yet the poor feral cat gets the blame for most of the demise of birds etc. We have returned adult feral cats to private properties where they were caught but only if the owners are happy to have them back and to provide food for them plus keep a general eye on them. Recently Jean received a phone call “second hand” saying they understood we were returning cats to the north coast where there is lots of wildlife plus the sheep. This is not true and we cannot understand why someone complained to the National Trust instead of contacting us personally. The cats are highly unlikely to harm the sheep and with the large number of wild ferrets and rats in the Island let alone birds of prey it’s a case of once again, feral cats being blamed for a decline in bird life. In the UK it’s a different story and adult feral cats neutered by CAT ’77 are quite often returned to site. They deal with feral cats in huge numbers with few homes for them to go to so it is their only option as none of our branches put cats to sleep unless they are terminally ill. Feral kittens are always put up for adoption along with domestic strays. The areas they are returned to are mostly urban or in the country usually on farms or small holdings, stables etc and even then they try to find someone to supply food for them on a regular basis. This is possibly where there has been a misunderstanding as the main CAT’77 website states that adult cats are returned to site after neutering and spaying but this does NOT apply in Jersey. This has been mentioned to the Executive Committee at the recent AGM and will be amended stating that Jersey is an exception.</p>\n<p>Once again Lisette and Carole attended the AGM in London at the end of September (at their own expense) and found that our UK colleagues are having the same problems as us. Many cats and kittens are being dumped as well as people exploiting their female cats by allowing them to breed for profit. Kittens are being advertised for sale predominantly through online advertising sites where sadly it is happening here too. People just don’t see the repercussions of letting their cats have a litter, even just one. The usual reply they give is - they have found the kittens good homes - but it doesn’t stop there as the people they went to may let their cats have a litter too and it goes on and on producing hundreds of cats from just one female.</p>\n<p>Although we have been advertising our initiative “Neuterline 2011” at various establishments around the Island including a spot on Channel Television and BBC Radio Jersey we have not had as many people take up our offer as had hoped. This is open to anyone who is on a low income and would like to have their cat spayed/neutered (a donation to our funds if possible would be appreciated) and includes micro-chipping. Please pass this on to anyone you think needs help in this way – they can ring Jean on 631113 and an appointment will be made at our vets at one of 3 different locations around the Island. Own transport is required as we do not have the facilities or the time to take people’s cats to the vet for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again when our Christmas Appeal is up and running. We understand how more and more difficult it gets each year supporting various charities with the economy the way it is these days. We can assure you that any money you can afford to donate to us will be wisely spent. All the money that is raised here stays in the Island. We are very proud of the fact that CAT ’77/HQ have amalgamated the outgoings of all the branches and 92% of funds raised are spent on the actual care of the cats that we all deal with. This includes food, litter and vet bills. We would say that here in Jersey the percentage is probably higher as we don’t have some of the outgoings that the UK branches do.</p>\n<p>Next Spring Jenny and a friend will do a couple of car boots for us selling just clothes but at the moment we have nowhere to store them in dry conditions. Does anyone have a bit of spare space in a dry shed, garage, spare room etc where we could store a few bags of good clothing. They have been packed away neatly and at the moment don’t envisage having more than 3 or 4 bags to store. If you can help, please ring Carole on her mobile - 07797 735077 – thank you.</p>\n<p>In the summer newsletter we mentioned receiving used stamps in the mail for which we incurred extra postage for. We are still receiving these packages so it would be appreciated if you could telephone Jean and she can let you know where they can be dropped off instead of posting.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',10),(46,11,4,1,1,1,'NewsPage','2012-11-04 18:43:18','2012-11-04 18:48:17','winter-newsletter-2011','Winter Newsletter 2011',NULL,'<p>Autumn was busy re-homing the kittens from pregnant females that we had taken in, luckily since they were born with us they were handled young and were really friendly and sociable. It was wonderful to see them settled in their new homes in pairs and a few went to homes with an existing cat for company. I feel it must be really lonely for one kitten on its own in a flat. Instead of playing with a companion it will destroy the furnishings!</p>\n<p>We have had many domestic cats brought to us for re-homing sadly due to a wide range of circumstances, luckily we were able to re-home many of them but as soon as they moved on to their new families more would arrive. Sadly many people seem to see cats as short term pets wanting to pass them on after a few years. With cats now living quite happily into their late teens or early twenties because of improved vet care it is a worrying situation.</p>\n<p>On the weekend of the Antiques Fair at the end of November, Jersey was hit by a snowstorm and the sale closed early as everyone was worried about driving in the snow. Jersey is not used to this! On the Sunday the roads were icy and again the fair closed early. Amazingly we still raised over £840! Needless to say the cats were not amused by the snow and had to be kept cosy with microwaveable heat pads!</p>\n<p>Due to the very cold conditions trapping has been very slow so it has been a good time to home some of the cats from the end of summer. No sooner did most of the younger ferals find permanent homes then three pairs of older cats arrived. They were all cats I had homed before and they were returning due to various reasons. I would like to ask people to consider taking on the older cats as they are so loving and gentle, they can be a good option for people who may not want to be committed to 20 years of cat care. It is sad when people insist on taking kittens, because an older cat may die and then pass on those same cats in a couple of years!</p>\n<p>To update last newsletters story on FIV cats:</p>\n<p>Piper and River have both found lovely homes and have settled very well into their indoor life.</p>\n<p>Spider and Squeak are lovely 12 year old brothers who lost their home on the death of their owner.

The cats are fortunate to have so many friends.

There have been so many kittens advertised for sale all because people want to make money from their female cats. We have heard all the excuses for allowing females to have litters apart from monetary profit i.e. a) wanting their children to experience seeing their cats give birth (most cats give birth in the middle of the night!) b) wanting their cats to have “just one” litter c) because friends have said what beautiful kittens she would have and they would like one d) because they never have a problem finding them good homes. Checking a local advertising website, we have noticed the selling price for kittens starts off high and over the weeks the same people reduce the price because they just cannot find homes for them. So what happens to all these kittens that are getting bigger and bigger with no homes to go to? Some are being taken to the shelter and some have been brought to us, but we fear some are being dumped (see below). Educating people on getting their female cats spayed is so important. If you know of anyone on a low income who needs help in having their cats spayed/neutered please tell them to ring Jean on 631113 and we will help rather than have another kitten explosion next year.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Four delightful 7 week old tabby and white kittens were discovered in a hedge where there were no properties nearby. We were contacted by a caring member of the public and they were brought to us. They were not feral and there was no sign of their mum. They were homed in pairs to loving homes but we will never know what became of their mum.</p>\n<p>Dumped- Two 8 week old kittens (brother and sister) were found in the back of a truck full of rubbish near town. Thankfully they were found by one of our supporters who brought them to us. They were frightened but were not feral. Despite checking the area over the next couple of days no other kittens or mum were found.</p>\n<p>Dumped - Five 7 week old kittens on Jean’s door step! These 3 female and 2 male tabbies and tabby/torties were in a short sided fruit box sitting quietly in the drizzle early November. We don’t know if there were any more than 5 or possibly mum too but they could easily have climbed out of the box. It is not known how long they had been there as no one saw them being left. “Going to the mainland please find homes, thank you” was written on the bottom of the box.</p>\n<p>Dumped - A young black &amp; white domestic female was trapped at one of our north coast sites but discovering she was feeding kittens had to be released back to the area. Perdita was very thin so was fed twice a day with lots of cat food, fish, chicken and cat milk. She was always hungry and would eat everything we gave her including biscuits that were left for her in a feeding box. The area was covered in gorse, brambles and steep valleys of ferns so was impossible to find the kittens. She always came when called but each time would appear from a different direction and after eating would disappear into the thick undergrowth making it impossible to follow her. We hoped she would eventually bring the kittens to us but it took 4 weeks to find them. She was an extremely affectionate cat and one evening after eating instead of retreating into the undergrowth she ran off through a grassy field but kept stopping, looking back and crying. She wasn’t happy till Carole followed her down a steep cotil and began to “call” into ferns at the side of the cotil. Suddenly 2 black and white kittens emerged from amongst all the greenery. By this time they were about 9 weeks old, already feral and were having nothing to do with Carole despite Perdi encouraging them to come to her – they had to be caught with our humane traps.</p>\n<p>Perdi was spayed and has now got a very loving home but despite her kittens, Baby Pingu and Cadpig being socialised for a few weeks we are still to find homes for them. Baby Pingu is the image of Pingu, the black and white feral cat we trapped in April in exactly the same area and we are sure he is their father which means Perdi was dumped before getting pregnant. Cadpig is just like his mum. They are very sweet kittens and we would love to find them a loving home together.</p>\n<p>A black &amp; white female (feral) was trapped on a private property with her two kittens, Cash and Fraser who were about 3 months old. Mum, Evonne, was spayed and returned to the owners of the property who were happy to keep feeding her. Cash a black &amp; white female and Fraser who is tabby are still looking for homes. Another black &amp; white cat was also trapped on a private property with her two kittens. The kittens, Tara and Pookie were around 3-4 months old and unfortunately mum Julieca was pregnant again. She was an abandoned domestic and has since given birth to five black kittens. Tara and Pookie have found a home together and Julieca is being fostered with her kittens till they are old enough to be rehomed.</p>\n<p>Belvedere, a black cat had been living rough in a small garden of a hotel car park where he spent most of his days under bushes. We were alerted to his plight by a couple who had started feeding him daily along with Lisette’s help. We noticed a very nasty sore on his head which needed to be seen to but trying to catch him proved difficult. He was extremely nervous, wouldn’t let us get close to him and kept well away from our traps. Eventually he was caught by hand and quickly put into a basket by the gentleman who had been feeding him but he was so badly scratched he had to go to A &amp; E for a tetanus injection. Once contained in a pen at Jean’s he proved to be a real sweetie so we hate to think what sort of treatment he had received in the past to have been so scared of everyone who tried to help him. Belvedere had a very badly infected wart on his head which had to be removed. He is now a much happier cat and needs a loving home. He has not been claimed so we must assume he was abandoned as well as there were no records of him as a missing cat.</p>\n<p>A call from a member of the public had us setting up feeding sites and trapping at Noirmont. A very small black kitten had been seen by several people near one of the car parks until it was chased by a Jack Russell dog. Apparently it was very tiny and was seen in the daytime. It was trying to eat some bread that had been put for it. We think it may have been dumped as a feral mum would still be feeding kittens at such a young age and there would be no need for a kitten to scavenge for food. Despite setting traps on many occasions we have not found it and we fear the worst especially if it is as young as we suspect. When we were first told about the kitten the weather was terrible with flooding and heavy rains but it was not all in vain as we did trap a grey and white feral kitten around 12 weeks old, Helmut, and an adult black male, Manfred. Manfred has had contact with humans as he is not as nervous as a true feral. These have now been neutered and looking for a home. Helmut’s mum still needs trapping as she was seen at the same time Carole first spotted Helmut in the gorse. She too is grey and white. We will persevere as long as we keep seeing evidence that kittens and cats are living wild in this area.</p>\n<p>One of our north coast sites is still producing cats and kittens just when we thought we had it all under control. In July a man contacted us to say he had seen a ginger mum run across the cliff path with three kittens in tow and disappear down the cliff face. Two were torties and one little ginger just like mum. We already had two other feeding places further along the cliff path which we’d kept going “just in case” but we set up another feeding box closer to where they were seen with kitten biscuits. We trapped mum, (Sweet) Cicely and five kittens, four of them being torties and the little ginger boy. Two of the torties, Cassia and (Star) Anise have found loving homes plus the ginger boy, Jalapeno. The remaining two, Penny (Royal) and (Spicy) Olida are still looking for that forever home. We are monitoring the area very closely for any others that may still be there.</p>\n<p>Since our last newsletter we have found three domestic cats that were microchipped and been missing for some time. Unbelievably their owners didn’t want them back! Thankfully this wasn’t the case with Millie. At the end of October we were contacted by staff of a business in St John, telling us about a little white cat that was roaming the property but she had no ears. She appeared nervous and apparently they had seen her sleeping on the cushioned seat of a fork lift but were unable to get close to her. With a bit of detective work we were able to trace Millie’s owners and it appeared she had been missing for 6 weeks from her home a couple of miles away. A few months previously she had an operation to remove her ear tips due to cancer. Although the owners came and looked for her they were unable to find her. Two days later on the Sunday morning 3 traps were set around the property and checked regularly through the day. Finally late afternoon Millie was trapped much to the delight of her owners who came immediately to collect her. She looked a sorry sight as she was very dirty and her ears were congealed with blood. A trip to the vet next day had her cleaned up and put on a special diet as she was very weak and had lost 1½ kg in weight. She was completely exhausted and the vet said she would not have had the strength to find her way home. All she wanted was lots of cuddles and we hope with all the TLC she is receiving she will make a full recovery.</p>\n<p>Many people who adopt cats from us are reluctant to adopt an older cat but a few years ago Pauline T. and family took on one of our oldies aged 17 as a foster cat. Sooty passed away this year having reached the grand old age of 25! Of course we were all sad to hear of her passing but so pleased she had a happy retirement and not been overlooked because of her age. Saffron is another “older” cat who belies her years, all 17 ½ of them – visitors to Jean’s home cannot believe the age of this active tortie as she runs around the place saying hello to everyone who visits. .</p>\n<p>Over the years we have been called out to all parts of the island to rescue a feral cat but never to Elizabeth castle. Jean had a call from the caretaker saying their resident feral cat (not from us) seemed very poorly and was hiding in an enclosed area but they couldn’t catch her. The Animal Shelter had suggested he contact us. Armed with a cage Jean went across on the Dukw and within a few minutes was able to corner the old cat and get her into the cage. Unfortunately she had a large tumour in her mouth which must have been causing her distress and was taken straight to the vets where our vet decided that euthanasia was the kindest thing. While in the waiting room a call was received from someone who had four 3 week old kittens looking for a foster mum. The kittens were from a farm and their mum had either abandoned them or may have come to harm. It is unusual for a feral cat to abandon her kittens but these needed a substitute mum quickly as 2 of them were very weak. Wendy one of our disclaimed domestic cats who had given birth in our care to 6 kittens 3 weeks earlier was chosen as their new mum. She accepted them immediately but despite her loving care, sadly the two weakest kittens didn’t survive. Her little brood of 8 have thrived and the other kittens accepted their new brother and sister.</p>\n<p>In one of our previous newsletters we wrote about Ebony, an old black cat that had moved around St Ouen for many years and finally found her niche in an area below Grantez. She was regularly fed by Carole and Sam but then luckily a lady Carole knew moved into one of the few properties in this area. Ebony soon came to know that this other Sam was her new feeder and we are grateful to Sam P for feeding Ebony for many months. Springtime, Ebony disappeared and we were all very worried as to what had become of her. One evening several weeks later, we received an anxious call from Sam telling us that Ebony had turned up but looked very unwell and was extremely thin. We went straight away with a trap baiting it with roasted chicken and thankfully it didn’t take long to trap her. Unfortunately Ebony was going into kidney failure and was put to sleep to save any more suffering. Ebony lived her life the way she wanted to and though she had gone “walkabout” we really think she returned to her favourite haunt to spend her final days. She is one little feral we will always remember with affection.</p>\n<p>Our AGM in London was held early October and Lisette and Carole attended on behalf of the charity (at their own expense). Once again it proved very enlightening and was well attended by supporters of the charity plus members from 7 of the 9 branches throughout the UK. While we are on the subject of the charity as a whole we would like to re iterate that all the money we raise in Jersey either through fund raising or donations stays in the Island as we are responsible for our own funds. We send our accounts to HQ yearly for auditing by the charity’s auditors and appreciate Jane B’s help here in Jersey in preparing the accounts as Jane is a qualified accountant and does all the work for us voluntarily.</p>\n<p>We are delighted with the commission we have received so far from the website - www.goanddonate.com. As mentioned in our summer newsletter they are a local website who donate 80% of commission received to the user’s nominated charity. So far we have received in the region of £700.00 from flights, hotels etc being booked on their website. Thank you to Islanders who have used the site and nominated us to receive the commission.</p>\n<p>We really appreciate all the cat food that is donated to the food bins in various supermarkets around the Island. This is a great help to us as we have so many cats to feed especially in the winter when cats are hungrier due to the cold and lack of food in the wild. The pregnant and feeding mothers plus kittens that Jean has been looking after in her home this summer have all had healthy appetites as well as the cats that reside with Jean permanently. We have a few places where a colony of cats have been returned to site after spaying and neutering and are fed by the property owner so every few weeks we deliver food to them to help out with the feeding. Without these people we would have had so many more feral cats to find homes for so thank you to Jo, Rosemary, Grace, Helen and Keith for taking on some of these feral cats. A lot of these cats are now entering their homes as they become more domesticated.</p>\n<p>We are happy to welcome Nikki back on board helping us with the trapping after an absence of a few years. It makes all the difference if there are a few of us who are experienced at trapping as it can be a very tiring and time consuming job and at night we always trap in twos at least.</p>\n<p>Fundraising this year has been successful with Jean and Jenny continuing to do car boots on a regular basis thanks to the generosity of our supporters who donate items for us to sell. We raised around £1,500 during the summer months at the monthly vintage fairs in St Aubin where we had an outdoor pitch. August was a complete washout with continual rain and Lisette, Pat P. and Carole braved the elements under a borrowed gazebo selling china only but got absolutely drenched. They think they made more money out of pity than actually selling items! Thanks to Arthur and Sue who run the fairs for giving us a free pitch again this year.</p>\n<p>The Antiques &amp; Collectible fair in May was a tremendous success when more than £1,200 was raised over the weekend. The next fair will be on Saturday and Sunday 27th and 28th November and we hope to have a repeat performance as there won’t be any more fund raising events till Spring. Thanks to Jason Cronin who organises the fairs for allowing us free space each time.</p>\n<p>Jayne and Kathleen had a stall at the Steam Fair Museum in September which is another good opportunity to promote our charity. Thanks to Kathleen for making her lovely marmalade, we believe it was a sell out.</p>\n<p>Jean Falk, Jayne Plain, Carole Georgelin, Sam Gotel, Lisette Le Creurer and Paula Gibson</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,3,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',10),(48,14,1,0,1,0,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:25','2012-11-04 18:54:25','new-article-list-page','New Article List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(49,14,2,1,1,1,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:25','2012-11-04 18:54:40','cat-health','Cat Health',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(50,15,1,0,1,0,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:52','2012-11-04 18:54:52','new-article-list-page','New Article List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(51,15,2,1,1,1,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:52','2012-11-04 18:55:07','new-article-list-page','Feral Care',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(52,15,3,1,1,1,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:52','2012-11-04 18:55:18','feral-care','Feral Care',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,2,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(53,9,4,1,1,1,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 17:50:28','2012-11-04 18:56:26','thoughts-of-chairmen-meow','Thoughts of Chairmen Meow','Cat Tips',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,4,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(54,16,1,0,1,0,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:00:18','2012-11-04 19:00:18','new-article-page','New Article Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',14),(55,16,2,1,1,1,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:00:18','2012-11-04 19:00:34','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',14),(56,17,1,0,1,0,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:01:08','2012-11-04 19:01:08','new-article-page','New Article Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',15),(57,17,2,1,1,1,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:01:08','2012-11-04 19:01:33','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',15),(58,3,3,1,1,1,'ContactPage','2012-09-28 23:25:52','2012-11-04 19:25:42','contact-us','Contact Us',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(59,16,3,1,1,1,'ArticlePage','2012-11-04 19:00:18','2012-11-04 19:27:18','article-one','Article one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',14),(60,14,3,1,1,1,'ArticleListPage','2012-11-04 18:54:25','2012-11-04 19:27:30','cat-health','Cat Health',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',9),(61,18,1,0,1,0,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:30:23','new-profile-list-page','New Profile List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',1),(62,18,2,0,1,0,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:30:55','new-profile-list-page','New Profile List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(63,18,3,0,1,0,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:30:55','new-profile-list-page','New Profile List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(64,18,4,1,1,1,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:31:45','jeans-feline-family','Jean\'s Feline Family',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(65,18,5,1,1,1,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:31:55','jeans-feline-family','Jean\'s Feline Family',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(66,18,6,1,1,1,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 19:30:23','2012-11-04 19:32:10','jeans-feline-family','Jean\'s Feline Family',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(67,19,1,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 19:46:04','2012-11-04 19:46:04','new-profile-page','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(68,19,2,1,1,1,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 19:46:04','2012-11-04 19:47:14','new-profile-page','Maggie May',NULL,'<p>When Maggie May was born out in the wild she had her umbilical cord twisted around her back leg.

He lived very happily there for some years until the property was due to be sold due to bereavement. Of course the cats then needed to be caught and removed.</p>\n<p>We duly collected Jay and 5 other cats. At that time he had no name but due to the fact that when he was in the car we could smell Jeyes fluid he earned the name Jay. On our journey back from the farm he started breathing very heavily and collapsed onto his side in the carrying box. Fearing the worst we drove straight up to the vet, it turned out to be a torn diaphragm and he needed emergency surgery to correct it and push all his organs back in the right place. It was a tense situation but he pulled through and was then rehomed.</p>\n<p>During this time we had noticed that he had problems with both his ears-they kept filling up with debris causing him some discomfort. A vet at the time operated on both ears to seal them up which he hoped would help the problem. Sadly this was only a brief respite and he kept having problems. Unfortunately around this time he managed to run away from his home and although very close his owners did not try to retrieve him. We stepped in to try and catch him but he proved very elusive and a number of members of the public who kindly tried to help ended up in casualty with cat bites (myself included!).</p>\n<p>However eventually we caught him in one of our traps. Obviously he was not going back to his old home so we managed to find him a new home with Ivan, whose previous companion had died. After a few spits and spats they settled down and were very happy together. Let no one tell you that you cannot introduce older cats – Ivan and Jay were both over 10 years old.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately his ear problems still plagued him and he was needing regular steroid injections which were not an ideal solution. Discussing this with our vet we decided that the only course of action would be to operate and take out the complete ear canal and sew up the skin making him look like an otter. As the only alternative would be to put him to sleep we agreed and he duly had the operation.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the photo he is a very happy cat now-his owner has said that his whole mood has improved. It was so successful that his brother Compton, who suffered the same problem has had the same operation with fantastic results. Compton is also FIV positive and apart from a few minor problems is also a happier cat. The operations took place in Summer 2008.</p>\n<p>We feel Jay is making very good use of his 9 lives!</p>\n<p>Sadly Jay\'s cat friend Ivan died of age related problems and Jay was unhappy being on his own so he has come back to live with the other cats where he is very happy and loves Prince the dog.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,7,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(92,26,1,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:04:22','2012-11-04 20:04:22','new-profile-page-2','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(93,26,2,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:04:22','2012-11-04 20:04:48','new-profile-page-2','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(94,26,3,1,1,1,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:04:22','2012-11-04 20:04:52','saffron','Saffron',NULL,'<p>Saffron is now well into her 21st year and is a permanent resident with Jean-she loves to meet everyone who visits.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,8,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(95,27,1,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:06:11','2012-11-04 20:06:11','new-profile-page-2','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(96,27,2,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:06:11','2012-11-04 20:06:37','new-profile-page-2','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(97,27,3,1,1,1,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:06:11','2012-11-04 20:06:41','bonnie','Bonnie',NULL,'<p>Bonnie is now a permanent resident due to her health but is very happy with the other cats.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,9,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(98,23,4,1,1,1,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 19:55:02','2012-11-04 20:09:34','miss-ellie','Miss Ellie',NULL,'<p>Miss Ellie was found after wandering alone for many years-she is very timid and now is a permanent resident with Jean.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,5,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',18),(99,28,1,0,1,0,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 20:11:27','2012-11-04 20:11:27','new-profile-list-page','New Profile List Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,12,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(100,28,2,1,1,1,'ProfileListPage','2012-11-04 20:11:27','2012-11-04 20:12:09','success-stories','Success Stories',NULL,'<p>Here are all the cats we have rehomed since 2010.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,12,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',0),(101,29,1,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:12:53','2012-11-04 20:12:53','new-profile-page','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',28),(102,29,2,0,1,0,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:12:53','2012-11-04 20:33:47','new-profile-page','New Profile Page',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,0,0,NULL,'Inherit','Inherit',28),(103,29,3,1,1,1,'ProfilePage','2012-11-04 20:12:53','2012-11-04 20:33:52','beau','Beau',NULL,'<p>Beau has found a fantastic home with a lovely family in the country.
